# Worksheet Generator – HTML Demo

This repository contains **public HTML demos** generated by a custom Python application for creating educational materials from Markdown.

The goal of this repo is to **show the final result**, not the internal implementation.

## What you see here

* **Full worksheet HTML**
  A complete version with exercises and solutions.

* **Cards HTML**
  A compact layout designed to print multiple small tests on a single A4 page.

Both versions are generated automatically from the **same Markdown source**.

## About the application

These demos are produced by a fully working **command-line Python app** that:

* creates and manages Markdown worksheet files
* converts Markdown to HTML using Pandoc
* generates different layouts (full and cards) from a single source

The application code is kept in a **private repository** and is **available upon request**.

## Use cases

The generator can be used to create:

* tests and quizzes
* practice worksheets
* study materials
